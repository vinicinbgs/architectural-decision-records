# ADR: A short noun phrase containing the architecture decision

## Context
In this section of the ADR we will add a short on- or two-sentence description of the problem, and list the alternative solutions that were considered.

## Decision
In this section we will state the architecture decision and provide a detailed justification of the decision.

## Consequences
In this section of the ADR we will describe any consequences after the decision is applied, and also discuss the trade-offs that were considered.
